        <p>Programming is what I love to do, ever since I was in college. I was first introduced to programming in middle school, they were HTML and CSS. These languages I did not understand them much at the time, so I didn’t pay much mind to them, but I did have fun. The second time was college with the programming language C++ cores I enrolled in. C++ really opened my eyes to the world of coding. It showed me that I can create almost any I can think of to life on the computer. My very first software I created was a calculator using C++, then it was a simple game I called “Don’t Get Hit.” After C++, Java jump into my coding world, Java really caught my interest, because it is found in almost every electronic device you can think of. With Java I also created a calculator along with a game call “floppy block” sounds like “floppy birds” right. Next in my programming world was HTML and with HTML the languages CSS, bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, MySQL, and PHP came in to join. This whole website you are looking at I created from scratch using those languages.</p>

        <p>Here is a one of the few projects I work on that I'm particularly proud of. <span><a href="https://bonisg.000webhostapp.com/index.html" target="_blank" class="clickMes">Boni's Garage</a></span> feel free to check it out.</p>

        <p>Programming is amazing isn't it?! Whenever I code and the project works it gives me a satisfying feeling. It feels like completing a puzzle, each piece you connect at the right spot gets you closer to completing the puzzle.</p>

        <p>You are probably wondering what applications I used to code in well, I’m not going to tell you…. joking. For C++ I used the app called Visual Studio 2007 to 2016 and for Java it was Eclipse. HTML, CSS, PHP, bootstrap, and JavaScript I went from using the app notepad to sublime, to visual code, and to Brackets. Which one is my favorite out of the four? Brackets is by far my favorite the reason is, because you can customize the theme to your liking and not only that you can preview your code in mobile or desktop mode. There is also extension that you can add to brackets, like create shortcuts for tabs in HTML and the developer that creates it updates any issues you notify him/her to.</p>

        <p>Do you have a favorite movie actor or actress? My favorite actor is Jim Carrey, he always made me laugh in every single movie or show he was in just looking at his face alone is enough. The very first movie I watch with Jim Carrey in it was The Mask. Next was Ace Ventura and after it was sequel to ace Ventura. Jim Carrey has really made it through a lot in his life and he has achieved many awards with the movies he has directed. The Ace Ventura Pet detective movie got him is first award as Best Comedic Performance as a nominee. The Mask which was in 1995 was his first award to win as Best Comedic Performance from there he became a star. He continued to win in every single movie he was in or made until 2009 which was the movie called Yes man.</p>
