        <p> If you didn't know I have a passion for coding, well this paragraph will. One program that got me hooked on others since the beginning was C++ the very first programming language I learn in college. After words Java jumped in, and next was HTML along with CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, MySQL, and PHP. With all the programming languages you can pretty much create everything you see and use it on the internet, mobile devices, and tables.
            <br>

         Here is a game I created using JavaScript and CSS.
