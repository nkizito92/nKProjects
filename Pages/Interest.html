        <p>Over the years people have been paralyzed. Technology has been evolving for some time, but there is very little that could help the paralyzed. In Today’s technology there is something called Virtual Reality (VR). Did you ever want to know what it feels like to be in an anime world or a video game, well that is what VR is for. With this tech people can experience the thrill of being in an anime, a video game, and more. Since VR has been created it has done many things, people can watch videos with 360 vision, others get to experience many states without leaving their living room, and most importantly the paralyzed can begin to learn how to walk again using VR.</p>

        <p> If you don't know I love coding well you will now. One program that got me hook on others since the beginning was C++ my very first programming language I learn in college. After words Java jumped in, and next was HTML along with CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, MySQL, and PHP. C# is beginning to catch my interest, because it’s a mixture of Java and C++. With all the programming languages you can pretty much create everything you see and use on the internet, mobile devices, and tables. Here is a game I created using JavaScript and CSS. <a href="../game/matchCards.html" class="links" target="_blank">Click me!!</a></p>
