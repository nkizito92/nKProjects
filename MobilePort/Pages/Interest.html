        <p>Unfortunately, some people have been paralyzed. Technology has been evolving for some time, but there is very little that could help. A tool that can aid this medical issue is Virtual Reality (VR). With this technology people can experience physical activity, an anime world, a video game, and so much more. Since VR has been created it has done many things. People can watch videos with 360 vision, others get to experience many states or other countries without leaving their living room, and most importantly the paralyzed can learn how to walk again using VR.</p>
        <br>

        <p> I have an immense passion for coding. One program that captured hooked me into the coding world was C++. This is the very first programming language that I learned in college. I quickly learned Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, MySQL, and PHP. With all these programming languages you can pretty much create everything you see and use it on the internet, mobile devices, and tablets.
            <br>
            <br> Here is a game I created using JavaScript and CSS.
